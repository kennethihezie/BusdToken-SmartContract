# BUSDHandler SmartContract

This project contains the implementation BUSD Token smart contract.

# Steps to setup and deploy BUSDHandler SmartContract
```
=> git clone https://github.com/kennethihezie/BusdToken-SmartContract.git

=> cd BusdToken-SmartContract

=> npm install

=> run ./test_script.sh in a shell terminal to execute test cases for the smart contract

=> run ./testnet_deploy.sh in a shell terminal to deploy contract to testnet. Contract can be deployed to bsc testnet, bsc mainnet and ploygon munbai network. By default its set to bsc testnet, to deploy to a different network, kindly edit the ./testnet_deploy.sh and add the preferred network.

=> By Default this project will use the specified credentials in the .env file to deploy contract, to change crendentials, edit the .env file.
```

In designing the smart contract, I prioritized both security and efficiency to create a robust and reliable system. To ensure security, I followed a multi-layered approach:

Code Auditing and Best Practices: I meticulously reviewed and tested the code according to industry best practices. This involved utilizing standardized design patterns, writing clean and well-documented code, and avoiding known vulnerabilities.

Input Validation and Sanitization: Rigorous input validation was integrated into the contract logic to prevent malicious input data that could lead to vulnerabilities like overflow or underflow attacks.

Secure Libraries and Dependencies: I exclusively used well-established, community-reviewed libraries and dependencies, minimizing the risk of using potentially compromised code.

Testing and Simulation: Rigorous testing was performed using various testing frameworks, such as Hardhat. I executed both unit tests and scenario-based simulations to ensure the contract behaves as intended in various scenarios.

For efficiency, I made the following design choices:

Gas Optimization: I carefully considered gas costs associated with each contract function, favoring optimized algorithms and data structures to reduce the overall cost of execution.

Minimized State Changes: I designed the contract to minimize unnecessary state changes, reducing the number of transactions and associated gas fees.

By incorporating these security and efficiency measures into the smart contract design, I aimed to create a trustworthy and high-performance system that meets the needs of users while minimizing risks and costs associated with its execution.
